## Section Overview | AgeTeller

Alright, here are the important concepts we covered by building AgeTeller:

- The ReactDOM handles the rendering of our application’s components onto specific pieces of the application’s html.
- The react-bootstrap package provides plenty of useful tools that allow us to create nicely styled forms and other custom components.
- With the constructor() and super() combination, we allow components to have dynamic state.
- By passing data through props, components receive data from their parents.

Once again, congratulations on building AgeTeller. Let’s now continue and start exploring Redux - a very popular alternative to managing state within React applications!
